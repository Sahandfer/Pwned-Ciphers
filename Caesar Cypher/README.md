## Caesar Cipher algorithm

> Each letter in a given plane text is replaced by a letter with some fixed number (key) of positions.

### Using the program

Run the following command in your commandline:

```shell
python main.py [Function Code][Sentence][key value]
```

Note: Function code ==> 1 for encryption, 2 for decryption with a given key, and 3 for brute force decryption
